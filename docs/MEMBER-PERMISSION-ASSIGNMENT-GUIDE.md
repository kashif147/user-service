# MEMBER Role Portal Permissions Assignment Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you assign Portal permissions to the MEMBER role in your staging User-Service database based on the specified access criteria.

## Prerequisites

1. **Portal Permissions Created**: Run `insert-portal-permissions.js` first to create the permissions
2. **MEMBER Role Exists**: Ensure MEMBER role exists in your staging database
3. **Environment Configuration**: `.env.staging` file with proper database credentials

## Permission Mapping

The script maps your criteria to User-Service permissions as follows:

### Full Access Resources (read, create, write, delete)

- **Portal**: `PORTAL_READ`, `PORTAL_CREATE`, `PORTAL_WRITE`, `PORTAL_DELETE`
- **Events**: `EVENTS_READ`, `EVENTS_CREATE`, `EVENTS_WRITE`, `EVENTS_DELETE`
- **Resources**: `RESOURCES_READ`, `RESOURCES_CREATE`, `RESOURCES_WRITE`, `RESOURCES_DELETE`
- **Change of Category**: `CHANGEOFCATEGORY_READ`, `CHANGEOFCATEGORY_CREATE`, `CHANGEOFCATEGORY_WRITE`, `CHANGEOFCATEGORY_DELETE`
- **Transfer Requests**: `TRANSFERREQUESTS_READ`, `TRANSFERREQUESTS_CREATE`, `TRANSFERREQUESTS_WRITE`, `TRANSFERREQUESTS_DELETE`
- **Communication**: `COMMUNICATION_READ`, `COMMUNICATION_CREATE`, `COMMUNICATION_WRITE`, `COMMUNICATION_DELETE`
- **Queries**: `QUERIES_READ`, `QUERIES_CREATE`, `QUERIES_WRITE`, `QUERIES_DELETE`

### Read-Only Resources

- **Application**: `APPLICATION_READ`
- **Dashboard**: `DASHBOARD_READ`

### Limited Access Resources

- **Profile**: `PROFILE_READ`, `PROFILE_WRITE` (maps from personalDetails & professionalDetails)
- **Payments**: `PAYMENTS_READ`, `PAYMENTS_CREATE`, `PAYMENTS_WRITE` (no delete)
- **Subscriptions**: `SUBSCRIPTIONS_READ`, `SUBSCRIPTIONS_WRITE` (maps from subscriptionDetails)
- **Voting**: `VOTING_READ`, `VOTING_CREATE`, `VOTING_WRITE` (no delete)

## Running the Script

### Method 1: Using Environment Variable

```bash
# Set staging environment
export NODE_ENV=staging

# Run the assignment script
node assign-portal-permissions-to-member.js
```

### Method 2: Direct Command

```bash
# Run with staging environment directly
NODE_ENV=staging node assign-portal-permissions-to-member.js
```

## Expected Output

üîç Verifying MEMBER role permissions...
‚úÖ MEMBER role now has 33 total permissions

üìÇ Permissions by Category:
-------------------------
  ‚Ä¢ PORTAL: 25 permissions
  ‚Ä¢ PROFILE: 2 permissions
  ‚Ä¢ FINANCIAL: 3 permissions
  ‚Ä¢ SUBSCRIPTION: 3 permissions

‚úÖ Portal permissions assignment completed successfully!
üéØ MEMBER role now has access to Portal resources as specified.

üîå Disconnected from MongoDB
```

## Complete Setup Process

### Step 1: Create Portal Permissions

```bash
NODE_ENV=staging node insert-portal-permissions.js
```

### Step 2: Assign Permissions to MEMBER Role

```bash
NODE_ENV=staging node assign-portal-permissions-to-member.js
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Connects** to your staging MongoDB database
2. **Finds** the MEMBER role in the database
3. **Maps** your criteria to existing User-Service permissions
4. **Identifies** which permissions to assign based on resource/action pairs
5. **Assigns** new permissions to the MEMBER role (skips already assigned ones)
6. **Reports** detailed summary of assignments
7. **Verifies** the final permission count and categorization

## Key Features

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically skips permissions already assigned
- **Smart Mapping**: Maps legacy resource names to current User-Service naming
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress and summary reports
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with clear error messages
- **Verification**: Confirms final permission assignment

## Troubleshooting

### MEMBER Role Not Found

- Ensure MEMBER role exists in your staging database
- Check that the role has `category: "PORTAL"` and `isActive: true`

### Permissions Not Found

- Run `insert-portal-permissions.js` first to create the permissions
- Verify permissions exist with the correct resource/action combinations

### Connection Issues

- Verify your `.env.staging` file has correct MongoDB credentials
- Check database connectivity and IP whitelisting

## Next Steps

After running the script:

1. **Test** MEMBER role permissions in your application
2. **Verify** users with MEMBER role can access Portal resources
3. **Update** your frontend to use the new permission codes
4. **Monitor** API access logs for permission validation

## Permission Summary

The MEMBER role will have access to:

- **33 Total Permissions** across Portal resources
- **Full CRUD access** to: Portal, Events, Resources, Change of Category, Transfer Requests, Communication, Queries
- **Read-only access** to: Application, Dashboard
- **Limited access** to: Profile (R/W), Payments (R/C/W), Subscriptions (R/W), Voting (R/C/W)

This provides comprehensive Portal access while maintaining appropriate security boundaries.
