## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### 1. Copy SDKs to Projects

```bash
# For API Developers
cp /path/to/user-service/sdks/node-policy-client.js ./policy-client.js

# For React.js Developers
cp /path/to/user-service/sdks/node-policy-client.js ./src/utils/policy-client.js
cp /path/to/user-service/sdks/react-policy-hooks.js ./src/hooks/policy-hooks.js

# For React Native Developers
cp /path/to/user-service/sdks/node-policy-client.js ./src/utils/policy-client.js
cp /path/to/user-service/sdks/react-native-policy-hooks.js ./src/hooks/policy-hooks.js
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# API Developers
npm install redis jsonwebtoken

# React Native Developers
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
# All Developers
POLICY_SERVICE_URL=http://user-service:3000

# API Developers
POLICY_CACHE_TIMEOUT=300000
POLICY_RETRIES=3
POLICY_TIMEOUT=5000

# React.js Developers
REACT_APP_POLICY_SERVICE_URL=http://user-service:3000
```

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Parallel Implementation

- Implement policy client alongside existing auth
- Test both systems in parallel
- Gradually migrate endpoints

### Step 2: Gradual Rollout

- Start with non-critical endpoints
- Monitor performance and errors
- Roll back if issues occur

### Step 3: Complete Migration

- Remove old auth middleware
- Clean up unused code
- Update documentation

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### API Testing

- [ ] Policy evaluation endpoints work
- [ ] Middleware protects routes correctly
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Cache performance is acceptable

### React.js Testing

- [ ] Hooks return correct permissions
- [ ] Conditional rendering works
- [ ] Route protection functions
- [ ] Token expiration handled

### React Native Testing

- [ ] Offline cache works
- [ ] Permission preloading functions
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Navigation protection works

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance

- Policy evaluation response time < 100ms
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- API response time improvement

### Security

- Zero unauthorized access incidents
- Complete audit trail
- Consistent authorization across platforms

### Developer Experience

- Simplified permission logic
- Faster feature development

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues occur during implementation:

1. **Immediate Rollback**

   - Revert to previous auth middleware
   - Disable policy service
   - Restore old permission checks

2. **Investigation**
