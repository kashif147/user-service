## üîê Access Control Summary

### Current Access Levels

| Access Level      | Roles     | Permissions                          | Count                    |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Read Access**   | All roles | `LOOKUP_READ`, `LOOKUPTYPE_READ`     | 25 roles                 |
| **Write Access**  | Level 30+ | `LOOKUP_WRITE`, `LOOKUPTYPE_WRITE`   | Available for assignment |
| **Delete Access** | Level 60+ | `LOOKUP_DELETE`, `LOOKUPTYPE_DELETE` | Available for assignment |

### Role Hierarchy Integration

The permissions are properly integrated with your existing role hierarchy:

- **Level 1**: All roles can read lookups and lookuptypes
- **Level 30+**: IO, HLS, CC, ACC, RO, BO, IRO, IRE, MO, DAM, AM can be assigned write access
- **Level 60+**: DIR, DPRS, ADIR, GS, DGS can be assigned delete access
- **Level 95+**: ASU, SU have full system access

## üß™ Verification Results

### Database Persistence ‚úÖ

- All permissions are stored in the MongoDB staging database
- All role assignments are persisted and validated
- Role categories have been properly set (SYSTEM, PORTAL, CRM)

### API Endpoints Ready ‚úÖ

- `GET /api/lookups` - All roles can access
- `GET /api/lookuptypes` - All roles can access
- `POST /api/lookups` - Requires write permissions (Level 30+)
- `POST /api/lookuptypes` - Requires write permissions (Level 30+)
- `PUT /api/lookups` - Requires write permissions (Level 30+)
- `PUT /api/lookuptypes` - Requires write permissions (Level 30+)
- `DELETE /api/lookups` - Requires delete permissions (Level 60+)
- `DELETE /api/lookuptypes` - Requires delete permissions (Level 60+)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **Test API endpoints** with different role levels
2. ‚úÖ **Update frontend** to check for permissions before showing UI elements
3. ‚úÖ **Assign write/delete permissions** to specific roles as needed

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Permission checks for UI
const canReadLookups = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUP_READ");
const canWriteLookups = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUP_WRITE");
const canDeleteLookups = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUP_DELETE");

const canReadLookupTypes = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUPTYPE_READ");
const canWriteLookupTypes = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUPTYPE_WRITE");
const canDeleteLookupTypes = userPermissions.includes("LOOKUPTYPE_DELETE");
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test read access (should work for all roles)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/lookups
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/lookuptypes

# Test write access (requires Level 30+ roles)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"code":"TEST","lookupname":"Test","userid":"user_id"}' \
     http://localhost:3001/api/lookups
```
